What is Source Code Review?
>A secure code review is a line-by-line analysis of the source code of an application, usually performed to find any security risks overlooked during the pre or post-development phase. A secure code review aims to analyze an application's source code and determine whether it has any security vulnerabilities or flaws.

**Common Vulnerability**
1. Hard-Coded Secrets in source code 
2. Insecure Algorithm Used 
3. Improper Exception Handling
4. Application Logs in Clear Text
5. DEBUG is enabled in the application
6. Eval Injection
7. Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
8. Use of Standard Pseudo-random Number Generators

|         |     |

## Implementation
- [ ] Does this code change accomplish what it is supposed to do?
- [ ] Can this solution be simplified?
- [ ] Does this change add unwanted compile-time or run-time dependencies?
- [ ] Is a framework, API, library, or service used that should not be used?
- [ ] Could an additional framework, API, library, or service improve the solution?
- [ ] Is the code at the right abstraction level?
- [ ] Is the code modular enough?
- [ ] Can a better solution be found in terms of maintainability, readability, performance, or security?
- [ ] Does similar functionality already exist in the codebase? If yes, why isnâ€™t it reused?
- [ ] Are there any best practices, design patterns or language-specific patterns that could substantially improve this code? 
- [ ] Does this code adhere to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design Principles, like the Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Close Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation, or Dependency Injection?

## Logic Errors and Bugs
- [ ] Can you think of any use case in which the
code does not behave as intended?
- [ ] Can you think of any inputs or external events
that could break the code?

## Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Is error handling done the correct way?
- [ ] Should any logging or debugging information
be added or removed?

- [ ] Are authorization and authentication handled correctly?
- [ ] Is (user) input validated, sanitized, and escaped 
to prevent security attacks such as cross-site

and political or religious belief?
- [ ] Does this code change introduce any algorithm, 
AI  or machine learning bias?


## Testing and Testability
- [ ] Is the code testable?
- [ ] Has the code change
- [ ] Have automated tests been added, or have related ones been updated to cover the change?
- [ ] Do the existing tests reasonably cover the code change (unit/integration/system tests)? 
- [ ] Are there some test cases, input or edge cases
that should be tested in addition?

## Readability
- [ ] Is the code easy to understand?
- [ ] Which parts were confusing to you and why?

smaller methods?
- [ ] Can the readability of the code be improved by
different function, method or variable names?
- [ ] Is the code located in the right

restructured to have a more intuitive control
flow?
- [ ] Is the data flow understandable?
- [ ] Are there redundant or outdated comments?
- [ ] Could some comments convey the message

expert or a usability expert, should look over
the code before it can be accepted?
