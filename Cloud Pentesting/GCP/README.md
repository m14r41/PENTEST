### 4. DNS Enumeration
   - Enumerate DNS records for GCP-related domains.
   - Identify public-facing services and subdomains.
   - Tools: DNS Enumeration Tools (e.g., dig, nslookup)

## Cloud Service Assessment

### 5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
   - Review IAM policies and roles for GCP resources.
   - Identify overly permissive permissions and misconfigurations.
   - Tools: Google Cloud Console, gcloud command-line tool

### 6. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
   - Assess VPC configurations, subnets, and firewall rules.
   - Check for exposed external IPs and unprotected services.
   - Tools: Google Cloud Console, gcloud command-line tool

### 7. Cloud Storage Security
   - Review Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket permissions.
   - Identify publicly accessible storage buckets.
   - Test for data leakage vulnerabilities.
   - Tools: Google Cloud Console, gsutil command-line tool

### 8. Kubernetes Security
   - Assess Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster configurations.
   - Check for unsecured dashboards and exposed APIs.
   - Identify privilege escalation opportunities within GKE.
   - Tools: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Console, kubectl command-line tool

## Vulnerability Assessment

### 9. Automated Scanning
   - Perform automated vulnerability scanning using GCP-native or third-party tools.
   - Identify vulnerabilities specific to GCP services.
   - Tools: Google Cloud Security Scanner, Third-party Scanners

### 10. Manual Vulnerability Testing
   - Conduct manual testing to identify complex vulnerabilities.
   - Test for authentication bypass, API vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations.
   - Tools: Manual Testing Frameworks, Burp Suite (if applicable)

## Exploitation and Post-Exploitation

### 11. Exploitation
   - Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
   - Exercise caution and perform exploitation with proper authorization.
   - Tools: Exploitation Tools, Metasploit (if applicable)

### 12. Privilege Escalation
   - Test for privilege escalation within GCP environments.
   - Check for overprivileged service accounts or IAM roles.
   - Tools: gcloud command-line tool, Manual Techniques

### 13. Data Exfiltration
   - Attempt data exfiltration from GCP resources.
   - Identify sensitive data exposure risks.
   - Test for data transfer controls.
   - Tools: Custom Scripts, Cloud Storage Tools

## Documentation and Reporting

### 14. Documentation
   - Thoroughly document all findings, vulnerabilities, and exploitation details.
   - Include screenshots, logs, and step-by-step instructions.

### 15. Reporting
   - Create a detailed pentest report with findings and exploitation proof of concept.
   - Include remediation recommendations and a risk assessment.

## Closure and Follow-Up

### 16. Remediation
   - Provide recommendations for remediation of identified vulnerabilities.
   - Collaborate with GCP admin and DevOps teams for fixes.

### 17. Validation
   - Verify the implementation of remediation measures.
   - Re-assess the environment for validation.
