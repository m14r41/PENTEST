## 1. Application Pentesting

> Secure your web, mobile, thick, and virtual applications. [link](https://github.com/m14r41/PENTEST/tree/main/Web%20Applications)

## 2. API Pentesting

> An API penetration test is a process to identify security vulnerabilities in an API. It is designed to determine if an API is susceptible to API vulnerabilities. [link](https://github.com/m14r41/PENTEST/tree/main/API%20Pentesting)

## 3. Mobile Pentesting

> Secure your **Mobile** and **iOS** with Automations and Manual Pentesting. Secure Android and iOS applications. [link](https://github.com/m14r41/PENTEST/tree/main/Mobile%20Pentesting)

## 4. Network Pentesting

> Secure your **internal**, **external**, and **wireless** networks. [link](https://github.com/m14r41/PENTEST/tree/main/Network%20Pentesting)

## 5. Secure Code Review

> Find application security vulnerabilities in your source code with SAST tools and manual review. [link](https://github.com/m14r41/PENTEST/tree/main/Secure%20Code%20Review)

## 6. Thick Client Pentesting

> Explore and test security vulnerabilities in thick client applications. [link](https://github.com/m14r41/PENTEST/tree/main/Thick%20Client%20Pentesting)

## 7. Cloud Pentesting

> Secure your **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Google** cloud infrastructures. [link](https://github.com/m14r41/PENTEST/tree/main/Cloud%20Pentesting)

## 8. IoT Pentesting

> Secure your ATM, automotive, medical, OT, and embedded devices and systems. [link](https://github.com/m14r41/PENTEST/tree/main/iOT%20Pentesting)

## 9. Blockchain Pentesting

> Uncover and understand blockchain security concerns. [link](https://github.com/m14r41/PENTEST/tree/main/BlockChain%20Pentesting)

## 10. CI/CD Pentesting

> CI/CD-integrated security systems can scan for bugs whenever new code is committed. This helps organizations make huge efficiency gains in software development. [link](https://github.com/m14r41/PENTEST/tree/main/CI-CD%20Pentesting)
