# Active Directory Pentesting Checklist

## Reconnaissance

### 1. Information Gathering

- [ ] Collect information about the target network, domains, and subdomains.
- [ ] Identify domain controllers (DCs) and their roles.
- [ ] Enumerate domains, trusts, and forests.
- [ ] Gather information about users, groups, and computers.
- [ ] Discover organizational units (OUs) and Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
- [ ] Find service accounts and their permissions.

### 2. DNS Enumeration

- [ ] Enumerate DNS information for the target domains.
- [ ] Identify DNS zones and records.
- [ ] Check for DNS misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Gather information about DNSSEC and DNSSecuring.

### 3. SMB Enumeration

- [ ] Enumerate SMB shares and permissions.
- [ ] Identify accessible shares, including hidden shares.
- [ ] Check for misconfigured shares or exposed sensitive data.

## Scanning and Enumeration

### 4. Port Scanning

- [ ] Perform port scanning to identify open ports and services.
- [ ] Enumerate commonly used ports (e.g., 135, 139, 445, 3389).
- [ ] Check for unusual or custom ports.

### 5. Service Enumeration

- [ ] Identify services running on target systems.
- [ ] Enumerate service versions and vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Pay attention to RPC, LDAP, SMB, and RDP services.

### 6. User Enumeration

- [ ] Enumerate users and groups.
- [ ] Gather information about user attributes.
- [ ] Check for locked or disabled accounts.
- [ ] Identify high-privilege users and administrators.

### 7. Password Policy Assessment

- [ ] Analyze password policies and complexity requirements.
- [ ] Check for password lockout policies and expiration settings.
- [ ] Look for password reuse vulnerabilities.

### 8. Kerberos Enumeration

- [ ] Enumerate Kerberos tickets and ticket-granting tickets (TGTs).
- [ ] Check for Kerberoasting vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Identify accounts with Kerberos pre-authentication disabled.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### 9. Vulnerability Scanning

- [ ] Perform vulnerability scanning using tools.
- [ ] Identify and categorize vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk and impact.
- [ ] Validate findings to eliminate false positives.

## Exploitation

### 10. Credential Harvesting

- [ ] Attempt to harvest credentials using techniques like SMB relaying.
- [ ] Exploit pass-the-hash (PtH) and pass-the-ticket (PtT) attacks.

### 11. Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attacks

- [ ] Exploit pass-the-hash vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Attempt to gain unauthorized access using harvested hashes.

### 12. Golden Ticket Attack

- [ ] Attempt to forge Kerberos tickets to impersonate domain controllers.
- [ ] Test for domain dominance and persistence.

### 13. Silver Ticket Attack

- [ ] Forge Kerberos tickets for specific services.
- [ ] Attempt to access target services without detection.

### 14. DCSync Attack

- [ ] Mimic domain controller synchronization requests.
- [ ] Extract password hashes and secrets from DCs.

### 15. BloodHound Analysis

- [ ] Use BloodHound for attack path analysis.
- [ ] Identify attack paths, privileges, and weaknesses.

## Post-Exploitation

### 16. Lateral Movement

- [ ] Attempt lateral movement through SMB, WMI, or remote desktop.
- [ ] Escalate privileges on compromised systems.

### 17. Persistence

- [ ] Establish persistence mechanisms in the target network.
- [ ] Create backdoors or rogue accounts.

### 18. Data Exfiltration

- [ ] Test for data exfiltration techniques.
- [ ] Attempt to transfer sensitive data to external locations.
