# CRTP Course Content: By [alteredsecurity](https://www.alteredsecurity.com/adlab)

## I. Active Directory Enumeration
- Use scripts, built-in tools, and the Active Directory module to enumerate the target domain.
- Understand and practice how useful information like users, groups, group memberships, computers, and user properties from the domain controller is available to even a normal user.
- Understand and enumerate intra-forest and inter-forest trusts. Practice how to extract information from the trusts.
- Enumerate Group Policies.
- Enumerate ACLs (Access Control Lists) and learn to find interesting rights on ACLs in the target domain to carry out attacks.

## II. Local Privilege Escalation
- Learn and practice different local privilege escalation techniques on a Windows machine.
- Hunt for local admin privileges on machines in the target domain using multiple methods.
- Abuse enterprise applications to execute complex attack paths that involve bypassing antivirus and pivoting to different machines.

## III. Domain Privilege Escalation
- Learn to find credentials and sessions of high-privileged domain accounts like Domain Administrators, extract their credentials, and use credential replay attacks to escalate privileges using built-in protocols for pivoting.
- Learn to extract credentials from a restricted environment where application whitelisting is enforced.
- Abuse derivative local admin privileges and pivot to other machines to escalate privileges to the domain level.
- Understand the classic Kerberoast attack and its variants to escalate privileges.
- Enumerate the domain for objects with unconstrained delegation and abuse it to escalate privileges.
- Find domain objects with constrained delegation enabled. Understand and execute attacks against such objects to escalate privileges to a single service on a machine or the domain administrator using alternate tickets.
- Learn how to abuse privileges of Protected Groups to escalate privileges.

## IV. Domain Persistence and Dominance
- Abuse Kerberos functionality to persist with Domain Administrator privileges. Forge tickets to execute attacks like Golden Ticket and Silver Ticket for persistence.
- Subvert domain-level authentication with Skeleton Key and custom Security Support Provider (SSP).
- Abuse the DC safe mode Administrator for persistence.
- Abuse protection mechanisms like AdminSDHolder for persistence.
- Abuse minimal rights required for attacks like DCSync by modifying ACLs of domain objects.
- Learn to modify the host security descriptors of the domain controller to persist and execute commands without needing Domain Administrator privileges.

## V. Cross Trust Attacks
- Learn to elevate privileges from Domain Admin of a child domain to Enterprise Admin on the forest root by abusing Trust keys and the `krbtgt` account.
- Execute intra-forest trust attacks to access resources across the forest.
- Abuse database links to achieve code execution across the forest by using just the databases.

## VI. Forest Persistence and Dominance
- Understand forest persistence techniques like DCShadow. Execute it to modify objects in the forest root without leaving change logs.
- Learn minimal permissions required to use DCShadow and avoid change logs for minimal permissions using Shadowception.

## VII. Defenses – Monitoring
- Learn about useful events logged when the discussed attacks are executed.

## VIII. Defenses and Bypass – Architecture and Work Culture Changes
- Learn briefly about architecture and work culture changes required in an organization to avoid the discussed attacks.
- Understand Temporal Group Membership, ACL Auditing, LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution), SID Filtering, Selective Authentication, Credential Guard, Device Guard, Protected Users Group, PAW (Privileged Access Workstations), Tiered Administration, and ESAE (Enhanced Security Administrative Environment) or Red Forest.
- Learn how Microsoft's Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) and similar tools detect domain attacks and ways to avoid and bypass such tools.

## IX. Defenses and Bypass – Deception
- Understand how deception can be effectively deployed as a defense mechanism in Active Directory.
- Deploy decoy user objects with interesting properties, which have ACL rights over other users and high-privilege access in the domain along with available protections.
- Deploy computer objects and group objects to deceive an adversary.
- Learn how adversaries can identify decoy objects and how defenders can avoid detection.

## X. Defenses and Bypass – PowerShell
- Learn about various improvements in Windows PowerShell v5 and their significance in detecting attacks.
- Discuss System-Wide Transcription, Enhanced Logging, Constrained Language Mode, AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface), etc.
