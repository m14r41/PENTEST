## Thick Client Application Security Testing

> Thick client applications are any that are installed locally on a user's desktop/laptop. These applications are full-featured and can run independently without being connected to the Internet, unlike web applications, which need to be connected to the Internet all the time. Some examples of thick client applications are:

1.  Computer games like Call of Duty, Uncharted, etc.
2.  Web browsers
3.  Music players
4.  Video and chat tools like Teams, Zoom, Slack, etc.

>**Thick client applications come in two flavors**

| Two-Tier Applications         | Three-Tier Applications     |
|---|------------|
| These are self-contained applications where the server/database and client are installed on the same machine or same internal network. Traffic from the thick client goes to the server directly without passing through an intermediary like the Internet or application server | These applications can connect over the Internet and have their business logic processed by an application server. The thick client resides on the user's desktop while the application server and database might be present elsewhere. Network connections and interactions typically usually happen using HTTP/S protocols, which allow for traditional requests / responses to occur. In addition, some thick clients may use alternate protocols like FTP/S, TCP, UDP, etc |

-   [  Echo Mirage](https://sourceforge.net/projects/echomirage.oldbutgold.p/)  – This is the Swiss army knife of thick client testing tools. Echo Mirage, which is similar to Burp / OWASP Zap, allows for traffic between client and server to be intercepted. Unlike Burp, there is no certificate to be installed locally (even though Echo Mirage can intercept encrypted traffic between client and server).
-   [Sysinternals Suite](https://download.sysinternals.com/files/SysinternalsSuite.zip)  – This comprehensive suite of tools from Microsoft allows testers to see what processes are spawned by the thick client application and the registry entries created or accessed by the thick client. Procmon and Regmon are two of the common tools in Sysinternals used to check for processes and registry entries. The suite also contains many other tools.
-   [Mallory](https://github.com/intrepidusgroup/mallory)  – This Linux-based tool can be used to capture TCP / UDP traffic.
-   [dnspy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases/download/v6.1.8/dnSpy-net-win64.zip)  /  [Dot Peek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windowsWeb)  /  [.Net Reflector](https://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/)  – .Net based thick clients may have hardcoded data or source code which may not be obfuscated. dnSpy and Dot Peek allow for deobfuscation and inspection of DLL files. .Net Reflector is a commercial tool which allows for decompilation of DLLs and for debugging.
-   Burp Invisible Mode – Burp has an invisible mode which allows for capturing traffic for proxy-unaware thick clients. This can be done by binding the loopback address to the remote domain / IP address. BAPP has  [NoPE](https://github.com/summitt/Burp-Non-HTTP-Extension)  Burp Extension, which is a good add-on for working with thick client traffic.
-   [Java Snoop](http://code.google.com/p/javasnoop/downloads/list)  – For Java thick clients, this allows for interception of any method in the JVM. Java Snoop works on existing Java processes by attaching itself to the running process.
-   Text Editors – Thick clients frequently leverage configuration files stored within the local system in plain text, often as .config or .ini files. Text editors can be used to inspect these config files for any sensitive content, such as hardcoded passwords, access tokens and keys, etc.
-   [Ollydbg](https://www.ollydbg.de/odbg110.zip)  /  [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/#download)  – Useful for reverse-engineering EXE and DLL files. Hex Editors and Strings are other tools which can be useful when searching for strings / keywords.
-   [Nmap](https://nmap.org/download)  – Useful for inspecting ports used by the thick client.
-   [Spy++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/introducing-spy-increment?view=vs-2022)  – This ships with Visual Studio and can be used for GUI Tampering.

 S.N  | ON the basis of  | thin client  | thick client |  
---|---|---|---|
 1.  | basic  | thin client is a lightweight computer that relies on the resources of the host computer.  | the thick client relies lightly upon the server and provides rich functionality. | 
 2.  | datastore  | in thin client, data is stored in servers.  | in thick client, data is stored locally. |  
 3.  | network latency  | in thin client, a fast and robust network connection is required.  | it can work with a slow network connection. |  
 4.  | offline working  | there is no offline working.  | offline working is possible in thick client. |  
 5.  | deployment  | the deployment is easier in thin client.  | unlike the thin client, the deployment in thick client is expensive. |  
 6.  | data validation  | in thin client, the data verification is done at server side.  | in thick client, the data verification is done at client side. |  
 7.  | local resources  | it generally consumes less local resources.  | unlike thin client, it consumes more local resources. |  
 8.  | security  | in terms of security, they are more secure than thick clients as they have fewer security threats.  | in terms of security, they are less secure than thin clients as they have more security threats. |
